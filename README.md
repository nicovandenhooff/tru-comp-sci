# TRU: Computer Science Courses

A repository that contains my programming files for the following Thompson Rivers University ("TRU") computer science courses that I completed:

1) [COMP 2231: Data Structures and Algorithms](https://www.tru.ca/distance/courses/comp2231.html)
2) [COMP 1231: Computer Programming II](https://www.tru.ca/distance/courses/comp1231.html)
3) [COMP 1131: Computer Programming I](https://www.tru.ca/distance/courses/comp1131.html)

The programming language required for each course was Java.  

I have also implemented a selection of the assignments in COMP 2231 and COMP 1131 in Python, as noted in the details for each course below.  Each course sub-folder contains the programming files for the course assignments.
